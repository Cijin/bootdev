# Chirpy

A simple http server written in Go built for learning. Very few external dependencies as I wanted to understand how the `net/http` package works before using libraries that build abstractions over it.

### Goal

The goals were to understand how the following could be achieved in go:

* Routing, with and without an external router lib
* How JSON works in go
* Serving API's and webhooks
* Flow control handling
* Bare bones middleware

## ⚙️ Installation

`git clone git@github.com:Cijin/bootdev.git`

Then run the following:

```
cd bootdev
go mod install
```
